# Computer Programming Assignments

These are the three additional tasks for the *Programming Portfolio*. 

Your programs should be hosted in your GitHub repo, along with your weekly work.

For full details of the assessment refer to the specification on MyBeckett.

Some folders contain files that may be useful, viz:
* Task2 contains three sample input files.
* Task3 contains a sample password file. (The passwords in it are "encrypted" using simple [ROT-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).)

The versions here are correct and current.
